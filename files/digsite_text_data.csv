Microsoft identity isn't easy to use for consumers or users in enterprises. for example, my outlook (consumer id) id has to be entered with complete domain name ( <id>@outlook.com) when logging in.

I then worked on a major overhaul of our code, at the behest of others, which shifted us to MSAL. I depended on our existing tests to assure consistency as I learned about MSAL by doing.

Now, having done that, I've become aware of how we're doing Identity work, and have started getting involved in design questions like, should we update to a new Azure Active Directory API to get a list of tenants for a given user.

What was your question or issue? 2. When did it occur - during development or after deployment? 3. Describe your support experience and **why it was the worst**",James Williams,"I've had enough dealings with Identity-Related code recently that I'm going to limit my response to that domain.

Best experience:
1. I was struggling to figure out how to get file locking right on the MSAL cache. We had some reentrancy issues in our code that we were trying to fix as we ported it into the MSAL-Extensions library.
2. This was during our switch from ADAL to MSAL, and was during development.
3. The problem space was difficult to even understand, because while MSAL was designed to be async, we had realized we needed to serialize access to the cache to avoid some advanced refresh-token merging errors. We started working through it on our own, but quickly realized that we needed some more knowledge of what MSAL was actually doing, so we reached out. The MSAL team met with us in Teams screen-sharing. We quickly realized that was insufficient, so we setup 3 ad-hoc in person meetings where one or the other of us crossed buildings to whiteboard in person. Through this we came to honestly see the MSAL team, and to an extent the greater Identity team, as full partners and have kept that relationship alive even as engineers come and go.

It was the best because I felt understood, and my difficult problem was acknowledged.

Worst experience:
1. We were given the mandate to add support for signing in with github.com through Visual Studio. We were directed to Active Directory who were going to support our scenario.
2. In all honesty, this is still an ongoing development point, in spite of having attempted to do this over 2 years ago.
3. We faced two fundamental issues working through this: a) Active Directory didn't have a clear design for how they would support us and b) Active Directory didn't understand our customer's needs and desires. Our actual support experience was driven by one very longsuffering PM from our team who worked with AD for about a year, trying to get an experience from them that would fill our needs. Eventually we got some flows from them that purportedly handled our scenarios, and I set to adopting them. I had a contact on the dev team who I'd occasionally reach out to with fiddler traces when something didn't work, or was insufficient, and in simple cases he'd come through, but I often heard ""oh, that's a new feature request, talk to XXXX person"" who would then hedge with a ""well, now we don't have enough time to add features"" and other such replies. Our only recourse would be to then drop back to our PM who would again work with AD to iron things out over a few months and we'd try again. Recently we've begun investigating our own processes for accessing github.com because we've simply run out of patience, and we see all github.com users as prospective customers, waiting for good support.

Why was it the worst?
I felt that AD got stuck trying to make it possible for people to log-in to everything using their github.com credentials, and in some senses, ignored people who wanted to actually use github as a resource; a path crucial to our customers. Our repeated attempts to work with them should have provoked some conversations about fundamental designs, but never did, and now we're considering dropping the AD support for this scenario as a result.",

I was having with permissions and getting something deployed. The tool for deployment had a clear point of contact that was actually accurate (create an IcM using this specific team), and the response was prompt. The person assigned to the ticket reached out with some initial ideas, but continued to work with me as we narrowed down the issue.

I feel I have had pretty good experiences getting most of my development questions answered from the public StackOverflow site. The response time/quality is not bad.

[Worst support experience]
I once was trying to understand the usage of some service API during the development/investigation phase of our product.
I posted my question to the internal StackOverflow. I think I have used the correct tags. I even added someone who seemed to be the subject matter expert on this area based on some past questions. A few weeks have passed but nobody has answered my question yet.
It's bad experience because I didn't get my question answered and I still don't know whom I should reach out to. I recall I tried to directly contact the owner team for questions in similar areas but was told to use the internal StackOverflow. But it seems the internal StackOverflow posts might not be closely monitored by the right owners?",

Our problem wasn't very complex, but what mattered most was it was solved very quickly

We were to use a component from another org in office 365, there wasn't any documentation, there was no specific point of contact person, everybody on the team would set the IM status as  away, response to IM or email was only if they feel like responding.

    - We normally gather custom feedback through the in-app Send-A-Smile integration, or UserVoice, etc.

2. [What are the main goals you and your team have when you start planning for the next version?]
    - Solve key issues, meet major new requirements raised from customers
    - Release those features that are originally planned but didn't get chance to ship in V1

3. [Does Microsoft identity comes into play when you are mapping out your vNext requirements? Why or why not?]

1. An in-depth study of, and support for, handling common non-MSFT identities (eg github [yes I know they're MSFT], facebook, google, ...).
2. Probably more interestingly, I'd try to start an identity architect consultant program, where 1st party partners could engage directly with a dedicated consultant who could coach them through the intricacies of identity, and aggregate issues to pursue improvements with MSFT services.

On the surface, it would appear to developers that they just get helped through their troubles, but underlying it all, there's a big chasm between working on something like MSAL, and seeing a customer getting hit with 4 tenants worth of 2FA every hour, trying to work with Visual Studio. Our team has enough clout to ask for the assistance we need for scenarios like that, but less renown teams may also discover obscure corner cases that really would be best brought to the attention of Microsoft Identity, and having a skilled architect working with them would serve as a conduit for feedback as well as design guidance.",

I think this will not only help promote our priority of customer obsession, but it's also a more tangible way to understand the beginning of the Microsoft identity. Then provide a diagram for how/where/what teams support all the paths of the information. 
For example, it is still unclear to me how/why an app is registered in public and then just ""promoted"" to other clouds. What if there are different requirements, for example, with credentialing, depending on the cloud? Why would they be directly linked? 
I am really big about diagramming, because with the amount of complexity and diversity of teams utilizing the identity service, trying to see as a developer which part of the pie you're trying to access from the big picture is much better than just hearing a few keywords here and there and then trying to figure out which parts are relevant to your work. 
Communication is such a significant and understated part of being a developer, and providing clear entry points for a variety of developers is definitely a challenge, but can be addressed with creative documentation and comes from (things like this!) a deeper understanding of the consumers of your platform.",
